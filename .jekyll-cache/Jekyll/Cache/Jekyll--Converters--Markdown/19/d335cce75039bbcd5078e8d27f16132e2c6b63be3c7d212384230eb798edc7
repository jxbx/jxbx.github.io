I"®<p>Hereâ€™s a very simple game which plays a little bit like Snake â€¦ without the snake. You play as the white dot, chasing a static enemy around the play area, and every time you catch the enemy it respawns in a random location. This is still trivial at the moment, since thereâ€™s no additional gameplay element to add increasing interest or difficulty. For now the limiting factor is simply your own endurance or boredom!</p>
