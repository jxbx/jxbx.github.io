I"><p>I was looking for a Javascript project which I could complete in a few hours, so I decided to have a go at the classic challenge of building a calculator from scratch. To avoid making this project over-complex I decided from the outset that it would be a good idea to set limits, which meant only building in basic arithmetic, and no fancy features like memory/recall. Setting a realistic scope from the outset was probably the biggest timesaver of all while making this, since adding extended functionality would have rapidly expanded the complexity of the program.</p>
