I"ù<p>I built the <a href="https://www.justinbailey.net/projects/enigmemulator.html">EnigMemulator</a> a loose clone of the Enigma code machine which was used by the German military to send encrypted messages during World War II. I‚Äôve been looking for a project to bed in some of the Javascript fundamentals I‚Äôve learnt, and this has been super fun to work on. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine">Wikipedia page</a> on the Engima machine is brilliant, so I recommend reading more there if you‚Äôre interested, but I‚Äôve tried to give a little flavour below of how the original machine worked before jumping into some details of the coding.</p>
