I"\<p>Recursive functions can be a bit mindbending when you first encounter them. As part of my process to understand them better I looked at some simple examples and tried to step through each function stage by stage to get an idea of how the seemingly paradoxical process of a function calling itself can actually return a result. My intial way into this was through the “bubbling up” analogy, which really intuitive and easy to grasp. Once that makes sense, there’s a refinement to the analogy which looks at the way the call stack manages function calls when a script is being run in browser.</p>
