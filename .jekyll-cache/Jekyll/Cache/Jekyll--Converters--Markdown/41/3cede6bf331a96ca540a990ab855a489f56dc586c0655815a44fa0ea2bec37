I"K<p>My friend Lucie pointed out earlier this week that 2021 is a rare year whose value is the product of two consecutive primes. Apparently this hasn’t happened since 1763 and won’t happen again until 2491. Clearly this has great cosmological significance, so I decided to check the figures in case of any awkward mistakes.</p>
