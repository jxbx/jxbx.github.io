    I'm a web developer specialising in front-end solutions combining clean coding with
    intuitive user interfaces and striking design approaches. I'm moving into the sector
    from a background in <a href="https://www.behance.net/justindraws">graphic design</a>.
    I'm looking for junior web development roles where I can contribute from the
    outset with my strong creative problem solving skills, while also building my
    knowledge and experience of the sector. You can view some of my sample projects

  <div class="container">
    <h1>A semi-random pattern generator</h1>
<p class="meta">09 May 1990</p>

<div class="post">
  <p>There are lots of pattern generators online; <a href="https://doodad.dev/pattern-generator/">here’s an example</a> of a really nice one, which lets you export your artwork as svg graphics for use in your design work. <a href="https://haikei.app">Here’s something similar</a>; this tool generates simple graphic elements.</p>

<p>I’ve always wanted to have a go at building a pattern generator which can create designs using typographic characters, and having recently used <a href="https://web.dev/variable-fonts/">variable fonts</a> in a project, I thought it would be really interesting to combine the two. With variable fonts, parameters like character weight can be continuously adjusted using CSS:</p>

<html>
  <style>
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Raleway:wght@100..900&display=swap');

    #container {
      font-family: 'Raleway';
      outline: 1px solid black;
    }

    #text1 {
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 50px;
      font-weight: 500;
      padding: 20px 0 0 0;
    }

    #weight1 {
      display: block;
      margin: auto;
      width: 50%;
    }

    #amount {
      display: block;
      margin: auto;
      width: 100px;
      padding: 0 0 20px 0;
    }

  </style>
<body>

  <div id="container">
    <p id="text1">Platypus</p>
    <input id="weight1" type="range" min="100" max="900" value="500" class="slider" oninput="changeWeight1()" />
    <p id="amount">Value: <span id="weightValue1">50</span></p>
  </div>

 </body>

 <script type="text/javascript">

   function changeWeight1 () {
     weightValue1.innerHTML = weight1.value;
     text1.style.fontWeight = weight1.value;
   };
 </script>

</html>

<p>Why not use characters from one of these variable fonts as elements in a pattern, and make these adjustable characteristics into parameters to help create different pattern designs?</p>

<p>How could this work? Well. let’s start with a simple character like “—”, the classic em dash. In the image below, I’ve started with a plain grid of em dashes, and created three new patterns just by applying some form of rotation to them. Initially, we’ve rotated all the characters by the same value so they lie on a diagonal; then, we’ve randomly rotated each character by either 0 or 90 degrees, to create an interesting maze-like figure; finally, we’ve gone full random, rotating each character by its own arbitrary amount for an effect which looks a bit like ice cream sprinkles.</p>

<p><img class="blog-img" src="/blog/assets/dashpatterns.png" /></p>

<p>This is already starting to look quite cool. I really like the simplicity of using typographic characters as graphic elements, particularly simple symbols like +, -, O, and ~ . Even simple manipulations can create striking patterns, and we quickly forget we’re looking at type. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a character input which allows you to apply these sorts of transformations on any character? What would it look like if we used symbols like A, &amp; or $ in these designs? What other parameters can we build into our pattern generator to give us even more flexibility?</p>

<p>Let’s start planning out the objectives for this project:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>We need some method of generating patterns using typographic characters - this will require some kind of character input and some way to adjust parameters on these characters.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of the following variables as parameters for the pattern generator:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Character spacing
Character orientation
Character weight (i.e. thickness)
Character colour
Character size
Background colour</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Some method of creating a repeating pattern from these designs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some method of downloading the designs in a useful graphics format</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some method of generating css from the designs so they can be used as background textures in web pages</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>For now, I’m looking at the first two objectives. I think it’s worth hacking together a working program as a proof of concept just to see whether this approach can work. After this, I’ll tackle point 3 and 4, which are concerned with creating a genuinely useful output from the program.</p>

<p><em>Building the grid</em></p>

<p>So how are we going to start this? First of all, I’m going to define a space for my pattern swatch. I’ll create the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gridContainer</code> div element and set its height and width to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">600px</code>. I’ll style it with the following CSS:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>#gridContainer {
  display: grid;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  grid-template: repeat(20, 50px) / repeat(20, 50px);
  position: relative;
  overflow: hidden;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a 20x20 grid, which I can populate with characters to form my basic pattern element. I’ve chosen a large grid because I want to allow for patterns with a lot of elements in them. I’m also going to build in functionality which allows the characters to be scaled, so I want to ensure that the grid is always big enough to fill the whole container even if the elements are close together. By setting  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">overflow-hiddden</code> I’m ensuring that any elements that don’t fit into the container are kept out of sight.</p>

<p>My full grid is going to contain 400 cells (20x20), and I’ll need to add an element to each of these. I don’t want to write that all out in html, so I’ll use this script to help me:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>for (let i=0; i&lt;400; i++){
  const para = document.createElement("div");
  para.className = "gridItem";
  para.setAttribute("id", "cell"+i);

  const node = document.createTextNode("—");
  para.appendChild(node);

  const container = document.getElementById("gridContainer");
  container.appendChild(para);   
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This loop will build each element, using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setAttribute()</code> to add the classname <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gridItem</code> and the id <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cell[i]</code> every time one of these elements is created.We can use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">appendChild()</code> to add text to each of these elements, and again to add each element to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gridContainer</code> .</p>

<p><em>Adjusting the elements</em></p>
